    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore how to perform clustering at the chunk level rather than the document level. Specifically, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load a single climate policy document\n",
    "2. Split it into chunks using the same strategy as in NB02 (line-by-line)\n",
    "3. Generate embeddings for each chunk using ClimateBERT\n",
    "4. Apply clustering techniques to identify topic clusters within the document\n",
    "5. Visualise the results using interactive plots\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows us to identify distinct topics and sections within a single document."
